title: My Biggest Challenges
---
There were so many challenges that I faced while learning the various web development skills. Out of all of them, I think the most difficult had to be... Staying motivated.

Passion is something I think is ill-defined. I do not believe it to be this unending love of a thing through thick and thin that never wavers. I believe it to be more of a dedication that is constantly tested through the good times and the bad. I think that my ability to continue on through this whole program shows my dedication and passion for the problem solving nature of coding. But this brings challenge number two...

The sheer level of problem solving was on a level I was not used to. I'm used to looking up all manner of answers for computer related issues, but when it came to coding, it was a whole different beast. Most of the time, I can come up with one definite solution to a problem. With coding, it would seem that every question had a hundred answers. None were wrong, yet none were really right. As it would happen, I had to cut and mash all different parts of answers to get the one I needed. Now if that isn't problem solving, I don't know what is.

I'm sure there was plenty more, but I can't quite bring any more to mind at the moment. But, I'm sure this post shouldn't be too flooded with my struggles. Besides, there's plenty more to come in the future.
