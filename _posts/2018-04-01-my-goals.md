Alright, my first post on my new site. Haven't really maintained a blog before, so I'll try to maintain this the best I can.

For now, I think a good first post would be about my goals as a developer.

Firstly, I think the most important thing for me right now is to learn all that I can. There can never be a thing as too much knowledge. Though, that knowledge isn't too useful without practical application. So that also means getting as much practice as I can.

This practice will likely come in small projects and possibly some small freelance escapades. I think I'll focus on Ruby on Rails, but there will definitely be merit in learning some other languages as well. I believe PHP and Python (with Django) will be a worthwhile investment.

The big goal would be landing an entry-level position. That will give me the real world experience I so desperately need. I believe it will be difficult to land, but I believe that I can do it if I stick with it.
