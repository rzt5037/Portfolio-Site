title: My Experiences With Bloc
---
Bloc was quite the program. In the months that I was apart of it, I learned so much and met so many interesting people. The variety of mentors that I met gave me a good idea of just how many types of people are involved with development. Also, my struggles with the various languages and projects really showed me how much problem solving there is even in the building aspect of things.

Of course, no lesson would be complete if I didn't run into unforeseen issues. I learned so much about managing different versions of a language just from having had compatibility issues. I probably wouldn't have received that experience had I anyone else's luck.

My mentors were also wonderful in giving me tools and resources that I would have never encountered on my own. Both professional tools as well as handy little tips and tricks to make my development life easier. That was something that I was incredibly grateful to receive.

As my program comes to a close, I hope to continue learning and to continue meeting such varied and interesting people. Here's to the days to come.
